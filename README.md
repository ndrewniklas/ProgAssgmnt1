Programming Assignment 1

This is an team assignment. For this assignment you will develop a design for a First Person Shooter (FPS) video game. You are to develop a high level architectural design of this system, and the objects that exist in and compose it. You will list the relevant classes for each object, and describe their attributes and behaviors.

Once the design for your system is complete, you are to develop skeletal code for this system, that is, Java classes for each of the classes, with their fields (representing attributes) and methods (representing behaviors). Again, this is skeletal code, so all the methods should remain empty, or filled with dummy code to make it compile (e.g. return null; if the methods declares that it returns some object).

You should also submit appropriate documentation supporting your design: what did you have in mind when you came up with the different classes, how do you envision this system working in the future?. Finally, you should include lessons learned with this exercise (as specified on the assignment guidelines). Remember to Javadoc the code with meaningful comments.

Follow the submission guidelines and send me an email with the compressed file. You will also submit a print-out of the source code and relevant documentation in class, during the class meeting immediately after the due date.

This assignment is worth 25 points.
